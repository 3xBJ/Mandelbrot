#Mandelbrot with openMP, pthreads and CUDA

The objective of this project is to compare the matrix generation time vs matrix save time and the execution time between openMP, pthreads and CUDA.

## Mandelbrot overview 
According to the [MathWorld](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/MandelbrotSet.html) article about Mandelbrot set :
> The term Mandelbrot set is used to refer both to a general class of fractal sets and to a particular instance of such a set. <br/>
> "The" Mandelbrot set is the set obtained from the quadratic recurrence equation<br/>

> where points C in the complex plane for which the orbit of z_n does not tend to infinity are in the set. Setting z_0 equal to any point in the set that is not a periodic point gives the same result.
